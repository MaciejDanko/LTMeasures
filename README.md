# LTMeasures
___________________________

This is a part of most recent project I have coded for MaxO group that deals with life-table measures. In attached an example, where I investigate two things: 1) the effect of interval length on precision of estimation/approximation of different life-table measures, and 2) how different methods of data ungrouping (based on PCLM method) can help to increase the precision of approximations life-table measures.

The details of the model can be found in PDF file
