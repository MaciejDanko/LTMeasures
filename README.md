# LTMeasures
___________________________

This code is a part of my most recent project. It was done for Jim's Vaupel MaxO group that deals with life-table measures as a part of contribution to the R-package. In the attached example I investigate two things: 1) the effect of age interval length on precision of estimation/approximation of different life-table measures, and 2) how different methods of data ungrouping (based on PCLM method) can help to increase the precision of approximations of life-table measures.

The more details about the model can be found in atached PDF file in the main directory.

The main code is in ./CODE/LifeTable_PCLM_AX.R
