# LTMeasures
This is a part of most recent project I have coded for MaxO group that deals with life-table measures.
In atached example I investigate two things
1) the effect of interval length on precission of estimation of different life-table measures
2) how different methods of data ungrouping (PCLM method) can help to increase the precission

The details of the model can be found in PDF file
